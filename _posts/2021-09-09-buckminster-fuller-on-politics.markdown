"Take from all of today's industrial nations all their industrial machinery, and all their energy-distributing networks, and leave them all their ideologies, all their political leaders, and all their political organizations and careful study shows that within six months, two billion people will die of starvation, having gone through great pain and deprivation along the way.
	However, if we leave the industrial countries with their present industrial machinery and their energy distribution networks and leave them also all the people who are routine jobs operating the industrial machinery and distributing its products, and we take away from all the industrial countries all their ideologies and all the politicians and political party workers and send them off by rocket ship to forever orbit the sun - the result will be that as many people as now will keep right on eating possibly getting on a little better than before. This will remove all barriers to completely free world intercourse and thereby permit realization of enough for all.
	The fact is that now - for the first time in the history of man - and only for the last 10 years, all the political theories and all the concepts of political functions are completely obsolete in any other than secondary housekeeping functions. The primacy of political ideologies is obsolete because they were all developed on the basis of the exclusive survival only of your party or my party - simply because there was not enough for both."

- Buckminster Fuller, “Utopia or Oblivion”
