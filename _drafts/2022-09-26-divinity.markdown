# Touching the Divine

Mythology gives us an opportunity to uncover the traits of Gods in men. We've used it through millenia to give us a window into our own souls, projecting the imperfections of ourselves onto supernatural beings and humans alike.

Religion used to be a coordinating force that facilitated coordinating behavior. We used it to encourage behavior that was good for society but not necessarily for the individual. Castes in India were used to encourage people to embrace their roles in society; giving to the poor in Christianity is used to reduce inequality.

It turns out that in a world that is increasing non-religious, these pro-social tendencies that look beyond an individual's needs and desires have only increased. This is the new divinity, humans connecting and giving to society for nothing more than their own desire to see others succeed.

Examples of this include:

Don Valentine giving over the partnership of Sequoia to Mike Moritz and Doug Leone; he gave ceded full authority to the extent that they could choose whether or not to keep him around. This marked a transition to Sequoia as an institution isntead of Sequoia being equivalent to Don himself. This adaptability of bringing in and incentivizing new blood is the reason that Sequoia is what it is today.
